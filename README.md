Working title: Hobby tracker
(Hobby projects management system)
This is a capstone app I am making to satisfy the requirements of the Web Dev diploma program with Brainstation. 
It's a simple CRUD app that helps people keep track of various hobby projects they engage in. 

Use Cases and Features
After logging in, a user can start a new tab for each of the projects they are currently working
on (e.g., 3 tabs for learning to draw, growing tomatoes and writing a short story), as well as
keep a bucket list of things to try some day and an archive with old projects in separate tabs.
For each individual project the user can:
- add pictures of/notes on what inspired this project,
- save links and other useful resources,
- upload progress photos,
- record the expenses on materials,
- plan steps,
- set a timeline and activate a timer to keep track of how long they work on something.
The user can mark the project as complete or shelved at any point and archive it, while also
writing a note/reflection about how they feel or if they want to come back to the project in the
future. A calendar view allows users to see how many days each month/year they devote to a
hobby. Photos and notes of the progress or finished product can be shared on social media.
